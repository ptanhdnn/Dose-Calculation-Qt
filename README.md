- The software will calculate the irradiation time based on the weight of the cargo placed in the boxes and the required radiation dose.
- By selecting different radioactive sources, the software will provide different irradiation time options, aiming to optimize the irradiation time for the product.
- Subsequently, based on real-time duration, the software will recalculate the actual irradiation dose or actual received dose that the product has absorbed.
